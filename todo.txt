Important:
==========
1. SystemTapTimerTask does *not* work properly
2. Check if all settings work as expected
- onPrepareDialog(): stap service is sometimes NULL (temporarily workaround)
- Replace JakeActionBar by something native

Nice to have:
=============
- Add message to send,list and delete log/output files
- Make app more android version independent
